                    In the early days of Christianity, followers of Christ met wherever 
                    spaces were available to them. Oftentimes these 
                    gatherings were held in wealthy peopleâ€™s spacious living facilities. 
                    These places that early Christians met came to be known as House Churches. 
                    These places served not only as a place to have Mass, but also as a haven 
                    from the Roman persecution of Christians.
